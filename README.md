# Natural Language Processing Exploration

This repository is a collection of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools focusing on syntactic and semantic analysis. It contains implementations for Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG), Dependency Parsing, and Relation Extraction, which are fundamental components for understanding the structure and meaning of natural language text.

## Overview

The tools provided in this repository serve as a framework for parsing sentences and extracting relationships between entities, which are essential tasks in many NLP applications such as information retrieval, question answering, and machine translation.

### Features

- **Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs)**: An implementation of PCFGs that allows for the probabilistic modeling of natural language syntax.
- **Dependency Parsing**: A module for analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences and representing it as a dependency tree.
- **Relation Extraction**: Techniques to identify and extract semantic relationships from text, facilitating the understanding of the text's meaning.
